Model Builder
=============

The model builder makes it easy to build the model definition files.

It will read JSON files as placed in "definitions" and will output the
completed files in "built".

You can then copy over the ones you want into src/FelixOnline/Core.

The JSON files follow a set format where all options must be set generally, and
all options must be set for each field. This means you can copy and paste an
existing definition to use as an example.

The model builder will check all files to ensure they are valid JSON, do not
omit any required fields, and make logical sense (e.g. foreign keys refer to a
foreign key) before the files are built.

Generated files should be fully PSR-1 and PSR-2 compliant, and will be
generated with a basic DocBlock and a constructor sufficient for making the
model work with the Felix Online BaseApp ORM.

You can specify external information in an "include"" file (useful for any
other methods you may have). The file should be called Foo.php and placed into
an "includes" folder in this directory, where Foo is the class name as defined
in the JSON file.

Any additional methods should follow PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding styles, and should
be both fully documented and have associated unit tests. Ignored code coverage
and the presence of an additional file will cause a validation failure. The
code should be indented with 4 spaces as the initial level to maintain
consistent indenting with the rest of the file generated by the model builder.

The JSON file does not need to match the class name.

To run, simply execute build_all.php from the command line (it cannot be run
via a web SAPI). All JSON files in the "definitions" folder will be built.
